## How do we record our progress?

- Practices
- Tools

## Some ideas

### What I've been doing so far

---

## Shared meeting notes

- Common resource between **advisor** and **us**
- Easy to revise old records
- Fill the notes **before** the meeting.
    - Questions
    - Ideas
    - Updates
    - Resources
- They prevent immediate and intermittent contact

---

## Shared meeting notes

- Notes should have a seamless access
    - First on paper, then to computer.
    - Simple Mardown file
    - Notes taking app
    - Cloud solutions: Google Docs, HackMD, Etherpad, etc.
    - What's best for you and your advisor

---

## Use git

- Easy to share access to your notebooks/code/data, etc.
- Great tool for contribution.
    - Reviews can be proactive: advisor can open a PR with changes.
    - Keep track of future tasks with Issues

## Use git

<div class="container">
<div class="column">

- It's distributed
    - We don't rely on cloud-based solutions.
    - Can be stored anywhere.
    - Can work offline.
    - Easy to backup and archive.

</div>
<div class="column">

- Can host **all the pieces** of your research
    - Data
    - Notebooks and code
    - Results and figures
    - Article
    - etc

</div>
</div>

###  Drawbacks of Git

- Hard to work with notebooks ([ReviewNB](https://www.reviewnb.com/) works pretty well)
- Not the best for commenting articles
- Curvenote could be a solution to the article writing step.


---

### Filling the repo with code

- Notebooks should be:
    - readable (both Markdown and code)
    - showcasing workflows:
        - read input
        - apply some methods
        - produce output
- Split **underlying code** from the **notebooks**
- Write **test functions** for the critical portions of your code.
    - Use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org)
